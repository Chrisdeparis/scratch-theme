# Scratch Theme for WordPress

## Grunt.js

You should only need to edit [`Gruntfile.js`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/grunt/Gruntfile.js) here.

Run `npm install` in this directory from your command line to install all of the Node packages. Once that's done, you can run `grunt` from the same directory to begin your automated workflow.
