# Scratch Theme for WordPress + ACF

## Images

Both of the Scratch logos are referenced in [`header.php`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/header.php) and [`login.scss`](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/scss/login.scss).

It's best to either place your images in `img/` or upload them via WordPress. If you choose the latter, and you've installed & activated Scratch's recommended plugins, you are also taking advantage of automated image resizing and optimization.
